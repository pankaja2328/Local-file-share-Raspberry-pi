# Local-file-share-Raspberry-pi
The Raspberry Pi Local File Share Module is a simple and efficient solution for creating a local file sharing system using a Raspberry Pi. This project leverages the Flask web framework to set up a web-based interface that allows users to upload, list, download, and delete files within a shared directory on the Raspberry Pi.
